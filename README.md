# SGEXTN ("SG" Extension for C++, Qt, and OpenGL)

## About this project...
This project was never supposed to exist... ok, it did exist, but just as a basic template app that I put on GitHub and just essentially wont touch again...

But I was building an app and had weird behaviour in the UI... Then I realised that I have been using QWidget style sheets wrongly the whole time, they are called **cascading** style sheets for a reason...

Obviously, I would rather have each button maintain its own style and be a separate object, instead of having global stylesheets being kaypoh all the time, and also I would rather have real properties in C++ then trying to parse a particularly blur JSON-ish variant called "CSS". Additionally, colours are unsigned ints, not random strings, that by the time it is parsed to change a widget colour, an old auntie could have walked from Tuas to Changi and back...

And that is incompatible with QWidget drawing, so I have to redo QWidget drawing...

But since I am rebuilding so much stuff, why not just wrap everything in my custom wrapper to make programming easier in future?

Thus this project: SGEXTN

Note that "SGX" is short for "SGEXTN", the project name, and is used as a prefix for all classes and structs. It does not reference anything else. "SGU" is short for "SGEXTN User Defined Class", these are classes that the programmer should write code in, unlike the SGX classes which the programmer should not touch. You are strongly recommended to began the name of application-specific classes with "SGC" for "SGEXTN-powered Application Custom Class".

## Built with...
- Qt (C++ GUI framework)
- OpenGL (through Qt, for rendering)

## Prerequisites
You must have Qt installed on your computer with necessary build tools.

## Installation
You download the source code.

## Using the software...
Download the source code and open it in Qt and start coding your project. The documentation is comments in header files, I made them as clear as possible.

## What to expect...
- [x] C++ primitives extensions
	- [x] SGXColourRGBA (RGBA representation of a colour with 8 bits per channel, wraps unsigned int)
	- [x] SGXColourHSLA (HSLA representation of a colour with 8 bits per channel, contains 4 floats)
	- [x] SGXIdentifier (GUID with automatic registering, wraps QUuid)
	- [x] SGXVector2 (a struct of 2 SGXFloats for 2D vectors)
	- [x] SGXTimeStamp (a signed long long representing number of seconds since 19650809 123000)
- [x] Qt GUI classes with custom drawing and resizing
	- [x] SGXRootWidget (root widget of the application, does nothing, inherits QWidget)
	- [x] SGXParentWidget (rendering space of the application, does nothing, inherits QWidget)
	- [x] SGXWidget (a widget with solid colour that does nothing, inherits QWidget)
	- [x] SGXText (a widget that displays text in SingScript, inherits QWidget)
	- [x] SGXIcon (a widget that displays text in a special icon font, inherits QWidget)
	- [x] SGXTextButton (a button with text display in SingScript, inherits QPushButton)
	- [x] SGXIconButton (a button that displays text in a special icon font, inherits QPushButton)
	- [x] SGXInputField (a input field taking a string which can be interpreted as a int or float, inherits QLineEdit)
	- [x] SGXLongText (a multiline text label, inherits QWidget)
	- [x] SGXLongInputField (a multiline input field, inherits QTextEdit)
	- [x] SGXScrollView (a scroll view container, inherits QScrollArea)
	- [x] SGXScrollBar (a scroll bar for the SGXScrollView, inherits QScrollBar)
	- [x] SGXLayout (a widget that has custom scripting to manage the layout of other widgets, inherits QWidget)
	- [x] SGXTouchReceiver (a nondisplaying widget that accepts touch events, inherits QWidget)
- [ ] OpenGL simplifications
     - [ ] SGXShaderDisplay (a widget that draws by OpenGL and contains a shader programme as a property, inherits QOpenGLWidget)
     - [ ] SGXShaderDataGroup (a struct containing a vao, a vbo, and a ebo, all in a group for 2D rendering, also contains methods for drawing and keeps tracks of buffer sizes)
	- [ ] SGXTransformFeedbackGroup (a struct containing a shader programme and 2 buffers for transform feedback)
	- [ ] SGXShaderGlobalVariable (a struct containing data to set shader uniforms)
	- [ ] SGXCuteSquishyVesicles (a widget overlay over the render space with visual effects including vesicles and sparkles, transparent to clicks)
- [ ] file system usage
     - [ ] SGXFileReader (struct allowing reading of all SGEXTN primitives from files with index seeking)
	- [ ] SGXFileWriter (struct allowing writing of all SGEXTN primitives to files with overwriting by index)
	- [ ] SGXFileSystemManagement (non instantiatable struct with static methods for file system operations)
	- [ ] SGXCannotLah (logging error messages in a file ".cannotlah")
- [ ] working application template

potential future extensions include networking stuff and PDF stuff and 3D rendering stuff and bluetooth stuff and more cross platform stuff

## Contributing...
The best way to contribute is to complain. To complain refers to informing me of a bug or suggesting a new feature to be included to the software. Pls refer to the "Contact me" section below.

If I perceive your suggested feature to be beyond the scope of the software, I will not approve it. However, you can still download the code and build your own feature. As long as you keep the .sg in your project name, I am ok with it.
